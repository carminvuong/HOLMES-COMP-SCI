            advantages of placing style information in... 
        </h1>

        <h2>
            ...a semantic element like h1
        </h2>
        <p>
            Placing style information in a semantic element can be useful if you want to alter
            only a single specified element and not all elements of the same type. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            ...a style element in the head
        </h2>
        <p>
            Placing style information in the head element can be useful if you want to alter all
            elements of the same type in the <strong>same</strong> document. This would be better than manually adding
            the style information to every element, as this would not violate NTTSTT, thus making
            your code less prone to errors.
        </p>

        <h2>
            ...a separate style sheet
        </h2>
        <p>
            Placing the style information in a different style sheet would be useful if you wanted
            to apply the style to the all elements of the same type in <strong>different</strong> 
            documents. Thus, this would be better than manually adding the style information to
            the different documents, because this would be an even better way to not violate 
            NTTSTT.
