        <h1>Task 4: Semantics similarities between indented paragraphs </h1>
        <p>
            The indented paragraphs looks better. The common semantics between the indented 
            paragraphs are that they are all steps intended for the reader to easily read. 
            The reader should expect these indented paragraphs to be a series of steps, 
            aiming to achieve the goal that is stated in the line beginning with 
            "3. View the source of this web page." A name

            Task 5: b elements
        </h1>

        <p>
            I do not think using <b>b</b> elements is correct. 
            According to the HTML documentation, the <strong>strong</strong> element is used when strong importance
            is stressed, unlike the <b>b</b> element. Additionally, the <strong>strong</strong> element accounts for the
            blind people, whereas the <b>b</b> element does not.
